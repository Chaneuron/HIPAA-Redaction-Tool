Comments: The finding of sickled-appearing cells in many of theautopsy tissue sections prompted the Hemoglobin S quantitationreported above. This quantitative result is indicative of sicklecell trait. Red blood cells in individuals with sickle cell traitare known to sickle as a postmortem artifact. The decedent’santemortem peripheral blood smear (made from a complete blood countcollected 5/25/20 at 9:00 p.m.) was reviewed by an expert HHChematopathologist at the Medical Examiner’s request. This reviewfound no evidence of antemortem sickling.
The decedent was known to be positive for 2019-nCoV RNA on 4/3/2020.Since PCR positivity for 2019-nCoV RNA can persist for weeks afterthe onset and resolution of clinical disease, the autopsy result mostlikely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity fromprevious infection.6/1/2020

IDENTIFICATION:
Positive identification is confirmed by comparison of antemortemand postmortem fingerprints (Federal Bureau of Investigation).

EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:
When initially examined, the body is in a sealed/locked andproperly labeled body bag. Evidentiary paper bags are securedover the hands.
The body is that of a normally developed, muscular andadequately nourished appearing, 6 feet 4 inch long, 223 poundmale whose appearance is consistent with the reported age of 46years. Unfixed lividity is present on the posterior dependentsurfaces of the body, except in areas exposed to pressure.Rigor mortis is established in all of the major muscle groups,relenting with modest pressure. The temperature is somewhatcool following refrigeration.
The scalp is covered with closely cropped black hair in a normaldistribution, with some early vertex thinning. The irides arebrown, and the pupils are round and equal in diameter. Theconjunctivae are somewhat injected, but there are no bulbar orpalpebral conjunctival petechiae. There are no facial,periorbital, or oral mucosal petechiae. The external auditorycanals are free of blood. The lobe of the left ear is remotelypierced once; the ears are otherwise unremarkable. The naresare patent. The nasal and facial bones are stable to palpation.A faint, 2 cm maximum dimension V-shaped scar is near thesuperior end of the left jawline. The teeth appear native andin good repair. Very short black mustache and beard stubble isin the usual distribution on the face, and a small patch ofslightly longer black beard hair is just inferior to the lowerlip.
The neck is straight, and the trachea is midline. A 0.6 cmdiameter circular gray-brown scar is over the middle of the leftclavicle. The chest is symmetric. The abdomen is flat. Theexternal genitalia are those of a normal adult male. The testesare descended and free of masses. Pubic hair is present in anormal distribution. The back, buttocks, and anus areunremarkable.
The upper and lower extremities are symmetric and free ofclubbing, edema, or absence of digits. Six faint,hypopigmented, haphazardly oriented linear scars ranging up to1.2 cm long are scattered across the dorsum of the right

forearm. Approximately eight gray-tan foci of healing injuries(scars) ranging up to 0.8 cm maximum dimension are scatteredacross the dorsum of the right hand. Two similar appearinghealing injuries (scars), each 1 cm maximum dimension, are onthe anteromedial right wrist. A similar appearing, obliquelyoriented 2 cm long linear healing injury (scar) is on the medialright wrist. The skin of the first dorsal webspace on the righthand has a 4.5 cm maximum dimension area of brownhyperpigmentation and gray-tan hyperkeratosis. An 8 cm maximumdimension area of brown hyperpigmentation and gray-tanhyperkeratosis spans the first dorsal webspace on the left hand,and has five superimposed healing linear skin cracks ranging upto 1.2 cm long. Similar gray-tan, scar-like areas are on thedorsum of the left hand (over the left 2nd and 3rdmetacarpophalangeal joints and the webspaces between thefingers) and wrist in areas ranging 0.2 to 2 cm maximumdimension. A 4 cm maximum dimension flat tan scar is on thedorsum of the left hand over the 5th metacarpal. The nails ofthe hands are cut or chewed extremely short.
A 4 cm maximum dimension horizontally oriented linear brown scaris over the anterior right hip. A 0.5 cm maximum dimensionmacular brown nevus is over the anterior right hip. Two flat,hyperpigmented patches, 1.2 and 2 cm maximum dimension, flankthe left side of the waistline. A 1.5 cm maximum dimensionhypopigmented oval scar is over the right knee. Approximatelynine haphazardly oriented linear hypopigmented scars ranging upto 2 cm maximum dimension are scattered over and just inferiorto the right knee. Approximately nine hyper- and hypopigmentedlinear and oval scars ranging up to 2 cm maximum dimension areover the right shin. A faint, 1.5 cm maximum dimension hyper-and hypopigmented scar is on the posterolateral left thigh.Five hypopigmented linear scars ranging up to 5 cm maximumdimension are over, just superior to, and just inferolateral tothe left knee. A 3 cm maximum dimension area of slight skindarkening associated with hair follicle plugging is on thedistal left calf. The nails of the toes are somewhat elongated,markedly thickened, and discolored yellow-brown. The soles ofthe feet and the posterior heels are somewhat hyperkeratotic anddesiccated appearing, particularly on the right.

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:

HEART (3-5):Cross sections of left ventricular, rightventricular, and interventricular septalmyocardium are examined and show the expectedmicroscopic architecture, with readily visibleboxcar nuclear changes in the septal and leftventricular sections. Cross sections of coronaryarteries, though not all ideally oriented,confirm the gross impression of atheroscleroticnarrowing.

LUNGS (6):Sections of right and left lung show generallynormal overall architecture, without malignancy,pneumonia, granulomatous inflammation, orpolarizable intravascular foreign material. Manysmall vessels contain rounded clear vacuoles,consistent with bone marrow embolism fromcardiopulmonary resuscitation.

LIVER (7):No significant pathologic abnormality (markedcongestion).

SPLEEN (7):No significant pathologic abnormality.

KIDNEY (8):No significant pathologic abnormality (markedcongestion).

PANCREAS (8):No significant pathologic abnormality.

ADRENAL (9):No significant pathologic abnormality (markedcongestion).

SPLEEN (9):No significant pathologic abnormality (markedcongestion).

BRAIN (10-12):Sections of hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebralcortex, and midbrain show the expectedmicroscopic architecture, without hypoxic-ischemic, reactive, neoplastic, or inflammatorychanges.

LEFT PELVIC


MASS (1,2):Decalcified (1) and routinely fixed (2) sectionsshow a proliferation of generally bland appearingcells with small to moderate amounts ofeosinophilic cytoplasm and generally uniformnuclei with neuroendocrine features. Occasional

nuclei show mild pleomorphism, but mitoticactivity is not seen. Much of the tumor iscomposed of cells in sheets, cords, and nests ina carcinoid-like pattern; other areas vary fromvascular to sclerosed and fibrotic. Takentogether, the gross and microscopic (H&E-stains)features of the lesion are most suggestive of anextraadrenal paraganglioma. AFB and GMS stainsare non-contributory.

NOTE:Many of the above tissue sections, particularlythose noted to have congestion, contain sickled-appearing red blood cells.

LC-MS/MSng/mLOther than the above findings, examination of the specimen(s) submitted did not reveal any positive findings oftoxicological significance by procedures outlined in the accompanying Analysis Summary.Reference Comments:11-Hydroxy Delta-9 THC (Active Metabolite) - Hospital Blood:11-Hydroxy Delta-9 THC is an active intermediate metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) the activecomponent of marijuana. Usual peak levels: Less than 10% of THC levels after smoking.1.4-ANPP (Despropionyl fentanyl) - Hospital Blood:4-ANPP (despropionylfentanyl) is a precursor chemical used in the production of fentanyl and is also a fentanylmetabolite. It may be used in the production of other related compounds such as acetyl fentanyl, butyrylfentanyl and furanyl fentanyl and may be a metabolite of these and other fentanyl-related compounds. It isconsidered to be pharmacologically weak.2.Amphetamines - Urine:Amphetamines are a class of central nervous system stimulant drugs, with some therapeutic uses, and a highpotential for abuse.This result derives from a presumptive test, which may be subject to cross-reactivity with non-amphetaminerelated compounds. A second test is necessary to confirm the presence of amphetamine related compounds.3.NMS v.18.0

NMSCP593102020-3700Page 2 of 7
Reference Comments:Caffeine (No-Doz®) - Hospital Blood:Caffeine is a xanthine-derived central nervous system stimulant. It also produces diuresis and cardiac andrespiratory stimulation. It can be readily found in such items as coffee, tea, soft drinks and chocolate. As areference, a typical cup of coffee or tea contains between 40 to 100 mg caffeine.The reported qualitative result for this substance was based upon a single analysis only. If confirmation testingis required please contact the laboratory.4.Cannabinoids - Urine:Cannabinoids are chemical compounds derived from the plant Cannabis sativa (marijuana), including activecomponents, chemical congeners and metabolites. Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal activecomponent.This result derives from a presumptive test, which may be subject to cross-reactivity with non-cannabinoidrelated compounds. A second test is necessary to confirm the presence of cannabinoid related compounds.5.Cotinine (Nicotine Metabolite) - Hospital Blood:Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine and may be encountered in the fluids and tissues of an individual as a resultof tobacco exposure.Anabasine is a natural product occurring in tobacco, but not in pharmaceutical nicotine and a separate test foranabasine in urine can be used to distinguish tobacco from pharmaceutical nicotine use.The reported qualitative result for this substance was based upon a single analysis only. If confirmation testingis required please contact the laboratory.6.Delta-9 Carboxy THC (Inactive Metabolite) - Hospital Blood:Delta-9-THC is the principle psychoactive ingredient of marijuana/hashish. Delta-9-carboxy-THC (THCC) is theinactive metabolite of THC. The usual peak concentrations in serum for 1.75% or 3.55% THC marijuanacigarettes are 10 - 101 ng/mL attained 32 to 240 minutes after beginning smoking, with a slow declinethereafter. The ratio of whole blood concentration to plasma concentration is unknown for this analyte. THCCmay be detected for up to one day or more in blood. Both delta-9-THC and THCC may be present substantiallylonger in chronic users. THCC is usually not detectable after passive inhalation.7.Delta-9 THC (Active Ingredient of Marijuana) - Hospital Blood:Marijuana is a DEA Schedule I hallucinogen. Pharmacologically, it has depressant and reality distorting effects.Collectively, the chemical compounds that comprise marijuana are known as Cannabinoids.Delta-9-THC is the principle psychoactive ingredient of marijuana/hashish. It rapidly leaves the blood, evenduring smoking, falling to below detectable levels within several hours. Delta-9-carboxy-THC (THCC) is theinactive metabolite of THC and may be detected for up to one day or more in blood. Both delta-9-THC andTHCC may be present substantially longer in chronic users.THC concentrations in blood are usually about one-half of serum/plasma concentrations. Usual peak levels inserum for 1.75% or 3.55% THC marijuana cigarettes: 50 - 270 ng/mL at 6 to 9 minutes after beginningsmoking, decreasing to less than 5 ng/mL by 2 hrs.8.Fentanyl (Duragesic®; Sublimaze®) - Hospital Blood:Fentanyl is a DEA Schedule II synthetic morphine substitute anesthetic/analgesic. It is reported to be 80 to 200times as potent as morphine and has a rapid onset of action as well as addictive properties.It is reported that patients lost consciousness at mean plasma levels of fentanyl of 34 ng/mL when infused with75 mcg/Kg over a 15 min period; peak plasma levels averaged 50 ng/mL.After application of a fentanyl transdermal preparation (patch), serum fentanyl concentrations are reported tobe in the following ranges within 24 hours:25 mcg/hour patch: 0.3 - 1.2 ng/mL50 mcg/hour patch: 0.6 - 1.8 ng/mL75 mcg/hour patch: 1.1 - 2.6 ng/mL100 mcg/hour patch: 1.9 - 3.8 ng/mL9.NMS v.18.0

Reference Comments:Following removal of the patch, serum fentanyl concentrations are reported to decrease with a meanelimination half-life of 17 hours (range, 13 to 22 hours).The mean peak plasma serum fentanyl concentration in adults given an 800 mcg oral transmucosal fentanylpreparation over 15 minutes is reported at 2.1 ng/mL (range, 1.4 - 3.0 ng/mL) at approximately 0.4 hours.Signs associated with fentanyl toxicity include severe respiratory depression, seizures, hypotension, coma anddeath. In fatalities from fentanyl, blood concentrations are variable and have been reported as low as 3 ng/mL.Substance(s) known to interfere with the identity and/or quantity of the reported result: 4-methylphenethylacetyl fentanylFentanyl / Metabolite - Urine:Fentanyl is a DEA Schedule II synthetic morphine substitute anesthetic/analgesic. It is reported to be 80 to 200times as potent as morphine and has a rapid onset of action as well as addictive properties.This result derives from a presumptive test, which may be subject to cross-reactivity with non-fentanyl relatedcompounds. A second test is necessary to confirm the presence of fentanyl related compounds.10.Methamphetamine - Hospital Blood:d-Methamphetamine is a DEA schedule II stimulant drug capable of causing hallucinations, aggressivebehavior and irrational reactions. Chemically, there are two forms (isomers) of methamphetamine: l- and d-methamphetamine. The l-isomer is used in non-prescription inhalers as a decongestant and has weak CNS-stimulatory activity. The d-isomer has been used therapeutically as an anorexigenic agent in the treatment ofobesity and has potent CNS-, cardiac- and circulatory-stimulatory activity. Amphetamine and norephedrine(phenylpropanolamine) are metabolites of methamphetamine. d-Methamphetamine is an abused substancebecause of its stimulatory effects and is also addictive.A peak blood concentration of methamphetamine of 20 ng/mL was reported at 2.5 hr after an oral dosage of12.5 mg. Blood levels of 200 - 600 ng/mL have been reported in methamphetamine abusers who exhibitedviolent and irrational behavior. High doses of methamphetamine can also elicit restlessness, confusion,hallucinations, circulatory collapse and convulsions.*In this case, the level of methamphetamine determined has not been differentiated according to its isomericforms. Differentiation of the isomers of methamphetamine is available upon request.11.Morphine - Free (Codeine Metabolite) - Urine:Morphine is a DEA Schedule II narcotic analgesic. In analgesic therapy, it is usually encountered as the parentcompound, however, it is also commonly found as the metabolite of codeine and heroin. In illicit preparationsfrom which morphine may arise, codeine may be present as a contaminant. A large portion of the morphine isbound to the blood proteins or is conjugated; that which is not bound or conjugated is termed 'free morphine'.Hydromorphone is a reported metabolite of morphine.In general, free morphine is the active biologic agent. Morphine has diverse effects that may include analgesia,drowsiness, nausea and respiratory depression. 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) is the 6-monoacetylated formof morphine, which is pharmacologically active. It is commonly found as the result of heroin use.12.Norfentanyl (Fentanyl Metabolite) - Hospital Blood:Norfentanyl is the primary inactive metabolite of the synthetic narcotic analgesic fentanyl.Substance(s) known to interfere with the identity and/or quantity of the reported result: Benzyl Fentanyl13.Sample Comments:001Physician/Pathologist Name: Dr. Andrew BakerUnless alternate arrangements are made by you, the remainder of the submitted specimens will be discarded one (1) yearfrom the date of this report; and generated data will be discarded five (5) years from the date the analyses wereperformed.NMS v.18.0
