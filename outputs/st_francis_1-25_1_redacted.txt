H&P Notes
I have reviewed the H&P, the patient was examined and NO change has occurred in the patient's H&P or condition
since the H&P was completed
With regards to possible operative intervention, risks and benefits of surgery were thoroughly discussed with the
patient. The potential risks of operative intervention discussed with the patient included but were not limited to the
general operative risks of death, bleeding, and infection. In addition, the patient was advised that surgical procedures
involving this segment of the spine could also result in paralysis, loss of bowel and bladder function, loss of sexual
function, as well as changes in sensation in the extremities that could include pain, numbness, tingling, and burning
which could be temporary or permanent. The patient was advised of the possibility of a spinal fluid leak which could
require additional intervention. The patient was counseled that the surgical procedure may fail to relieve his or her
symptoms or could potentially make his or her symptoms worse. The potential benefit of operative intervention would
be to achieve a reduction in the severity of the patient's symptoms.

10/30/2023 - Admission (Discharged) in St. Francis Medical Center 6N Ortho/Surg (continued)
Discharge Summary Note (continued)
Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness
This 81-year-old male who has been suffering from chronic pain syndrome and chronic neuropathy has failed
nonsurgical treatment options and elected to proceed with placement of permanent spinal cord stimulator after a
successful trial spinal cord stimulator.
Hospital Course
Patient arrived to the hospital on 10/30/2023.  Patient had not taken her morning blood pressure medication and had
slightly elevated blood pressure and preoperative area.  Anesthesia gave approval and clearance to move forward
with surgical intervention is felt that blood pressure could be well controlled during surgical procedure with appropriate
medication.
The surgical procedure and placement of the spinal cord stimulator was uneventful and completed without
complication.  Patient was transferred to the PACU and was doing well within recovery.  Approximately 3 hours post
surgery patient was standing at bedside without complaints of leg weakness or numbness.  Within the next hour, at 4
hours postop my staff was notified that the patient was having weakness and decreased sensation in his lower
extremities.  I immediately presented to the hospital for evaluation of the patient.  Patient was without motor function of
his bilateral lower extremities as well as loss of sensation.  At this point the patient was taken back to the operating
room emergently for evacuation of suspected epidural hematoma and removal of spinal cord stimulator.  During his
postoperative course in PACU patient had unresponsive blood pressure.  Patient had consistent blood pressure
systolic 180- 240.  Multiple attempts by anesthesia as well as consult with hospitalist with different medications to treat
patient's blood pressure.  It is presumed that the patient's elevated systolic blood pressure postoperatively contributed
to development of epidural hematoma at the surgical field.
Post procedure patient noticed improvement of his symptoms continued to have some weakness of his lower
extremities.  A subsequent MRI was obtained this was delayed due to the fact that there was concern for metal within
the patient's body and multiple attempts at MRI were completed.  MRI was finally obtained there was found to be an
epidural hematoma more cephalad to the surgical site.  At this point time after discussion with neurosurgery colleague
best surgical solution would be to return to the OR for evacuation of epidural hematoma via bilateral hemilaminotomies
as well as placement of permanent spinal cord stimulator for treatment of chronic pain and neuropathy that would
ensue
Clinical Indicators: Impaired balance/sensation, weakness to core and BLEs. 9 x 14 x 90 mm (AP x TV x CC) dorsal
epidural hematoma extending from T5-T9, largest at T8 … associated severe canal stenosis, mass effect on the spinal
cord spanning T7-T8. Longitudinal central cord edema extends from T6-T10.
Risk Factor(s): Severe canal stenosis, mass effect on the spinal cord spanning T7-T8 from epidural hematoma likely
due to elevated systolic blood pressure postoperatively..
Treatment: IVF LR bolus/maintenance, incision/drainage/evacuation,  IV Ancef, IV Vancomycin, PT/OT evaluations, IV
dexamethasone, monitor labs/VS’s.
Discharge Condition: Stable
Weight: 86.2 kg (190 lb)
Discharge instructions discussed with: Patient, Family, and patient discharged to inpatient rehab for aggressive
therapies working on strength and conditioning of bilateral lower extremities.
Active Issues Requiring Follow-up
